# Mini-Project
A Python program that allows the user to play an extended version of Battleship with the computer.

Algorithm design (major steps):
  1. Create userâ€™s account or login using existing account
  2. User inputs ship and target coordinates
  3. Reporting if the attack was a hit or a miss
  4. Updating user and computer boards to determine results of the game.
